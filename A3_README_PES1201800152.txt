In this assignment we have used state space search to find the solutions to the problem
Water Jug 
The Data structures used by me were are the following 

1.)Doubly Linked List 
2.)Array of function in the order mentioned in the problem statement 

I basically tried to implement various functions to carry out the state space search 
The are of two types 

>>>List related functions and its structure :

struct node
{
    state curr;
    struct node * prev;
    struct node * next;
};
typedef struct node Node;

struct List
{
    Node * head;
    Node * tail;
};
typedef struct List List;

void initList(List * mylist);
void add_at_end(List * mylist,const state * curr);
void delete_at_end(List * mylist);
int is_repeated(List * mylist, const state * curr); // checks if the node is repeated.
void disp_list(const List * mylist);

>>>State related functions and its structure:


struct state
{
    int a;
    int b;
    int c;
    int next_func_index;
};
typedef struct state state;

void setState(state * curr, int a,int b, int c); // initializes the state

int moveAB(const state * src , state * dst);// moves and checks whether valid and return the same
int moveAC(const state * src , state * dst);// moves and checks whether valid and return the same
int moveBA(const state * src , state * dst);// moves and checks whether valid and return the same
int moveBC(const state * src , state * dst);// moves and checks whether valid and return the same
int moveCA(const state * src , state * dst);// moves and checks whether valid and return the same
int moveCB(const state * src , state * dst);// moves and checks whether valid and return the same

void disp_state(const state * curr);
int is_valid(const state * curr);
int are_same(const state *lhs, const state *rhs); //checks if two states are same or not .

The key takeaway from this assignment was that 
I understood how AI actually works and also about pointers to the functions 
It was a very good assignment overall.
